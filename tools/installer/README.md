# BMad CLI Tool

## Installing external repo BMad official modules

For external official modules to be discoverable during install, ensure an entry for the external repo is added to the marketplace `registry/official.yaml` source of truth. Add the same entry to `modules/registry-fallback.yaml` only when BMAD-METHOD needs a bundled fallback or a staged registry supplement.

For community modules - this is handled through the marketplace community registry.

Use `module-definition` for conventional module repos with `module.yaml`.
Use `source-root` for pure skill bundles that should be copied directly into `_bmad/<module-code>/`.
This keeps the external repo as the source of truth and avoids vendoring generated skill payloads into BMAD-METHOD.

Experimental modules can set `type: experimental` and `install-targets` to limit which IDE integrations receive their skills. For BMad Automator specifically, the current support matrix is Claude Code and Codex entrypoints, Claude Code and Codex worker sessions, and macOS, Linux, or Windows via WSL.

## Post-Install Notes

Modules can display setup guidance to users after configuration is collected during `npx bmad-method install`. Notes are defined in the module's own `module.yaml` — no changes to the installer are needed.

### Simple Format

Always displayed after the module is configured:

```yaml
post-install-notes: |
  Thank you for choosing the XYZ Cool Module
  For Support about this Module call 555-1212
```

### Conditional Format

Display different messages based on a config question's answer:

```yaml
post-install-notes:
  config_key_name:
    value1: |
      Instructions for value1...
    value2: |
      Instructions for value2...
```

Values without an entry (e.g., `none`) display nothing. Multiple config keys can each have their own conditional notes.

### Example: TEA Module

The TEA module uses the conditional format keyed on `tea_browser_automation`:

```yaml
post-install-notes:
  tea_browser_automation:
    cli: |
      Playwright CLI Setup:
        npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
        playwright-cli install --skills
    mcp: |
      Playwright MCP Setup (two servers):
        1. playwright    — npx @playwright/mcp@latest
        2. playwright-test — npx playwright run-test-mcp-server
    auto: |
      Playwright CLI Setup:
        ...
      Playwright MCP Setup (two servers):
        ...
```

When a user selects `auto`, they see both CLI and MCP instructions. When they select `none`, nothing is shown.
